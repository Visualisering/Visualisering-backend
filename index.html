    <h1>iViz-backend</h1>
    <p>This is the backend-server for the opensource-project "Visualisering". The project is created during the course "Webproject 1" at the Linneaus University in Sweden. 
    The server retrieves and process commit-data from the github-api and there are two ways that the server retrieves the data:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>With a get request to github with information on which repos server wishes to get commit info from.</li>
        <li> With an active github webhook that POST commit information to application endpoint /commit when a push is made to an organization repo.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Connect client to websocket</h2>
    <p>Create your own connection to the websocket-server by connecting to: </p>
    <pre>ws://iviz-back.herokuapp.com/</pre>
    <p> Depending on framework and libraries used this can be done in different ways, but usually, you create a connection to the websocket-server by using: </p>
    <pre>let ws = new WebSocket("wss://iviz-back.herokuapp.com");</pre>
  
     <h2>Recieve data from websocket</h2> 
     <p>Once connected to the websocket-server, you can get hold of the data through sending the message:<code>{"type":"WS_REQUEST_DATA"}</code> to the server. This can be done by using: <code>ws.send({"type":"WS_REQUEST_DATA"});</code></p>
    <p> You will find more information about using websockets and writing client-side applications using websockets on MDN: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">Websockets on Mozilla Developer Network</a></p>

    <p>If you just want to take a look at the data you can use a Websocket client such as the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-websocket-client/pfdhoblngboilpfeibdedpjgfnlcodoo?hl=en">Simple WebSocket Client</a> - plugin to Chrome or
  using an online test-client such as <a href="http://www.websocket.org/echo.html"> websocket.org/echo.html</a>. Simply connect to the websocket server and send the message <code>{"type":"WS_REQUEST_DATA"}</code> to look at the data available.</p>
  
    <h2>Data available</h2>
        The data available at the moment are commits and the location of the committers from repos of the project-members. If you want to configure your own app and add your own repos to watch, 
        please checkout the <a href="https://github.com/Visualisering/Visualisering-backend/blob/master/README.md">readme</a> in our <a href="https://github.com/Visualisering/Visualisering-backend.git">github-repo</a>.

    <p>When asking for data, you will then get a response with the following content:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"positions": Gives an array with objects containing latitude, longitude and a unix timestamp for commits made in the repos defined in the application, updated everyday at 22 CET.</li>
        <li>"commits": Gives an array with objects containing reponame, owner of repo, timestamp, message, committer, filename and code from the file(base64-encoded) for commits made in the repos defined in the application, updated everyday at 22 CET.</li>
        <li>"wh_commits: Same info as in "commits" but data is recieved through posts to /commit from github-webhooks defined in repos, data is recieved in real-time</li>
        <li>"wh_positions: Same info as in "positions" but data is recieved through post to /commit from github-webhooks defined in repos, data is recieved in real-time</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Customize...</h2>
    <p>Please fork this repo and configure with your own repos and use your own webhooks! Read further on the  <a href="https://github.com/Visualisering/Visualisering-backend/blob/master/README.md">repo-readme</a> for instructions how to customize your application.
